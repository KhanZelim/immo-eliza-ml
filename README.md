## 🏢 Description

Third part of the Immo Eliza project. This focuses on predicting real estate prices using machine learning models. It includes cleaning, preprocessing of the data, feature engineering, training multiple linear regression, XGBoost, and random forest models, and evaluating their performance. The project structure is designed to separate the processes into modules for better readability and maintenance.
